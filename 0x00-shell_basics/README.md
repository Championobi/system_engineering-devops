This project introduces the basics of Linux file system navigation and fundamental shell commands, designed for those new to programming. Through these tasks, learners will gain hands-on experience in viewing directory contents, understanding file structures, and writing simple shell scripts to perform common operations. The goal is to build a foundational understanding of how to navigate and manage files within the Linux command-line interface.

Instructions
Start by completing the quiz you see below. Once you complete the quiz, you can see the activity tasks mentioned in these instructions.
Complete the tasks one by one and follow the submission instructions below to submit your solution to the tasks.
How to Submit

1. Repository and Directory Setup

Ensure you have a GitHub account set up. If you are new to GitHub, use the GitHub website (https://github.com) to create your repository and upload files.
Create a new repository named system_engineering-devops.
Inside this repository, create a directory called 0x00-shell_basics where all your script files for this project will be stored and ensure that you have a README.md file in the directory.
2. Adding Files for Each Task

Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the 0x00-shell_basics directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., 0-current_working_directory).
3. Submitting Your Project

Once all files are uploaded to the GitHub repository, verify that your directory structure and filenames match the requirements.
4. Using GitHub UI (Preferred Method)

You can easily upload files through GitHub’s web interface by clicking “Add file” > “Upload files” in your project directory.
For learners comfortable with the command line, feel free to use git commands to interact with GitHub.
Auto-Checking Process
At the end of the submission deadline, the auto-checker will review the tasks for correctness and award points. Ensure each script functions as expected and follows the naming conventions.

Important!
All your files must have this as the first line. This will enable the checker to execute your files.
#!/bin/bash
